# 💫 About Me:
I’m a B.Tech CSE student and an aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on backend development.
Currently, I’m building a full-stack project using Node.js and Express.js, where I’m designing RESTful APIs, handling server-side logic, and working with databases.

I have hands-on experience with Java and Spring Boot for backend development, including building secure APIs with JWT-based authentication and integrating MySQL databases.
On the frontend, I use React to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through code, learning backend architecture, and consistently pushing my work to GitHub to track progress and improve every day.

🚀 Currently focused on: Node.js backend development, API design, and full-stack project building.
